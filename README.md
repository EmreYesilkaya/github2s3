# 📦 Backup Automation Using Restic and Docker

This repository automates the process of backing up GitHub repositories to Amazon S3 using Restic and Docker. It is designed to offer flexibility by allowing backups to be stored either as **files** or temporarily in memory for space efficiency. This project ensures data safety with encryption and offers several customizations for users.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated GitHub Backup**: Periodically back up repositories to S3.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Runs smoothly in Docker containers, ensuring an isolated environment.
- **Restic Integration**: Provides encrypted and efficient backups.
- **Flexible Storage**: Choose between storing backups as files or in temporary memory for disk space savings.
- **Environment Configurations**: Easily customizable with environment variables.
  
## 📋 Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Amazon S3 bucket access for storing the backups.
- GitHub API token for accessing repositories.

## 🔧 Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backup-automation
cd backup-automation
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Ensure that you have filled in the necessary credentials in the `.env` file. For security purposes, **DO NOT** share these files publicly.

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
RESTIC_PASSWORD=your-restic-password
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
```

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t restic-backup .
```

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container
You can start the backup process by running the following command:
```bash
docker run --env-file=config.env restic-backup
```

## 📂 Configuration
- `config.env`: Contains your environment variables such as AWS credentials, GitHub token, and Restic password.
- `secrets.env`: Ensure this file is properly **protected**. It contains sensitive data and should never be uploaded to GitHub. 

**Important**: You can configure whether to store the backups as files or in temporary memory. Storing in memory saves space and increases efficiency.

## 🛠 Restic Installation

You can install **Restic** by following these steps if you are not using the Dockerized version:

```bash
# For Linux systems:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install restic

# For macOS systems:
brew install restic
```

Once installed, initialize Restic:
```bash
restic -r s3:s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name init
```

## 🔄 Backup and Restore Examples

### Backing Up a Repository
```bash
restic -r s3:s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name backup /path/to/repo
```

### Restoring from Backup
```bash
restic -r s3:s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name restore latest --target /restore/path
```

## 🧹 Disk Space Savings
To save disk space, you can store backups in **temporary memory** instead of persistent storage. This can be achieved by configuring the project to use the `/tmp` directory. It is a good option when dealing with large datasets where storage is limited.

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- **Encryption**: All backups are encrypted using Restic, ensuring that data is protected.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that sensitive information like your AWS keys and GitHub tokens are stored securely and not exposed in public repositories.

- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Amazon S3 Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)

## 💡 Additional Notes
- This project is designed to be flexible, supporting different backup strategies depending on your needs.
- If you're running this on Kubernetes or another cloud provider, ensure that proper IAM roles and security policies are in place.

# Jenkins Pipeline Usage

This Jenkinsfile automates the process of pulling a Docker image from Docker Hub, running it, and sending an email notification in case of failure. The pipeline runs every 12 hours.

## Steps

### 1. Add the Jenkinsfile to Your Project
Place the Jenkinsfile from this repository into the root directory of your project.

### 2. Configure Docker Hub Credentials
You need to configure your Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the Jenkins Dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Credentials** > **System** > **Global credentials (unrestricted)**.
3. Add new credentials with your Docker Hub username and password, and set the **ID** as `dockerhub-credentials`.

### 3. Create a Jenkins Job
1. Create a new **pipeline** job in Jenkins.
2. Configure the source to pull from your GitHub (or another repository).
3. Under the **Build Triggers** section, select **Build periodically** and enter the following cron expression:
   ```bash
   H */12 * * *
This will schedule the job to run every 12 hours.
4. In the Pipeline section, ensure that Jenkins is pointing to the correct Jenkinsfile path (e.g., Jenkinsfile in your GitHub repository).

4. Run the Job

Once the Jenkins job is set up, you can either run it manually or let it run automatically every 12 hours. When starting the job, you will need to provide the Docker Hub image URL as a parameter.

### Parameters

	•	DOCKER_IMAGE: The Docker image URL from Docker Hub (e.g., username/repository:tag). This should be passed as a parameter when triggering the job.

### Automated Execution

The pipeline is set to run automatically every 12 hours. If the job fails, Jenkins will send an email notification to the specified email address.

### Failure Notification

If the pipeline fails, an email will be sent to you@example.com. You can check the Jenkins console output for more details about the failure.
# Kubernetes Setup for CronJob and Secret

This guide explains how to set up a Kubernetes CronJob that runs every 12 hours and uses a Kubernetes Secret to manage environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- kubectl configured to interact with your cluster.
- Docker image pushed to Docker Hub (or any other registry).

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Create the Kubernetes Secret

We first need to create a Secret in Kubernetes to store environment variables securely. Make sure your secret values are encoded in base64 before adding them to the Secret YAML file.

#### Example: Convert Secret Values to Base64

To convert secret values to base64, use the following command:

```bash
echo -n 'your-secret-value' | base64 
# Kubernetes Setup for CronJob and Secret

This guide explains how to set up a Kubernetes CronJob that runs every 12 hours and uses a Kubernetes Secret to manage environment variables.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster up and running.
- kubectl configured to interact with your cluster.
- Docker image pushed to Docker Hub (or any other registry).

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Create the Kubernetes Secret

We first need to create a Secret in Kubernetes to store environment variables securely. Make sure your secret values are encoded in base64 before adding them to the Secret YAML file.

#### Example: Convert Secret Values to Base64

To convert secret values to base64, use the following command:

```bash
echo -n 'your-secret-value' | base64
```

#### Secret YAML (`secret.yaml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: docker-env-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  EXAMPLE_KEY: c2VjcmV0LXZhbHVl # Example secret value encoded in base64
  ANOTHER_KEY: YW5vdGhlci12YWx1ZQ== # Another example secret value
```

To apply the Secret, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
```

### 2. Create the Kubernetes CronJob

Next, create a Kubernetes CronJob that will run every 12 hours and pull a Docker image from Docker Hub. The CronJob will also use the previously created Secret.

#### CronJob YAML (`cronjob.yaml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: docker-image-cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "0 */12 * * *"  # This will run the job every 12 hours
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: docker-image-job
            image: <DOCKER_HUB_IMAGE_URL>  # Replace with your Docker Hub image URL
            envFrom:
              - secretRef:
                  name: docker-env-secrets  # References the Secret created earlier
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "bash /mnt/data/backup.sh && echo Job Completed"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

To apply the CronJob, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
```

### 3. Monitor the CronJob

You can verify that the CronJob is working correctly by checking its status and the jobs it creates.

#### Check CronJob Status

```bash
kubectl get cronjob
```

#### Check Running Jobs

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```

#### View Pod Logs

To view logs of a specific pod (replace `<pod-name>` with the actual pod name):

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

### 4. Conclusion

You have now set up a Kubernetes CronJob that runs every 12 hours, pulling a Docker image from Docker Hub and using environment variables from a Kubernetes Secret.

---

## Files

- `secret.yaml`: Defines the Kubernetes Secret for environment variables.
- `cronjob.yaml`: Defines the Kubernetes CronJob that runs the Docker container.

Make sure both files are applied to the cluster using the `kubectl apply` command.
